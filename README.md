# Connect SDKs

This repo contains the source for the SDKs we generate for developers to use
Connect API v2. The first two SDKs we will release are in PHP and Ruby.

## SDK Layout
Each SDK consists of core code that is written expressly for the language,
along with classes generated from the proto files that define the API (in the
  `connect-public-protos` repo).
