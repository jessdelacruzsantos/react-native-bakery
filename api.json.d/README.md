'api.json.d' folder contains the Open API/Swagger specification files (api\*.json) that
is output by the script/api-parser tool.

The specification files are intentionally gitignored in this repository to
prevent commit drift between two separate repositories. Make sure to copy the
files output here to the 'api.json.d' folder or else no one else will see them.
